## Overview
This is a Newbie rated challenge which I decide to take on to see how much basics thing I can still remember and apply. The challenge focus on just HTML and CSS.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned a new one line CSS style for displaying image perfectly.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<img src="your source" alt="your alt name" />
```
```css
img {
  inline-sizing: 100%;
}
```

### Continued development

I will still work on perfecting CSS Flex and how to let the Price section of my solution display responsively.
